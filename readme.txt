# BrokeFlix

A little application to stream movies because we're too broke for Netflix and too lazy to search online.

## Running the Script

There are two methods to run the script:

### Method 1: Direct Script Execution

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/BrokeFlix.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd BrokeFlix
    ```

3. Install dependencies (if any):
    ```bash
    # Add any necessary installation commands here
    ```

4. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

### Method 2: Using the Release

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/your-username/BrokeFlix/releases) section.

2. Download the latest release package (`BrokeFlix.zip`).

3. Extract the contents.

4. Navigate to the `dist/BrokeFlix` directory.

5. Run the application:
    - On Windows:
        ```bash
        BrokeFlix.exe
        ```
    - On Linux/Mac:
        ```bash
        ./BrokeFlix
        ```

## Important Notes

- **Two Ways to Run:** Choose the method that suits you best: directly running the script or using the downloadable release.

- **Disclaimer:** Please enter the correct movie or TV show name as listed on IMDb. Incorrect names may result in non-functional links. If the title doesn't exist on IMDb, the video won't work.
